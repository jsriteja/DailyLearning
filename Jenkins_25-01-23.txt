Jenkins:

Jenkin is a java Application
Jenkins is a powerful application that allows continuous integration and continuous delivery of projects,

Continuous Integration: is a process of integrating code changes from multiple developers in a single project many times.(Or)
CI - Continuous Integration A process where team members integrate their work continuously in a shared repository  
Best achieved using some SCM tools like GIT
Can be daily or as needed Every integration or checkin in the repo is validated by automated build,automated unit or integration tests

Continuous Delivery: is a process, where code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for a release to production. I hope you have enjoyed my previous blogs on Jenkins

Blue Ocean: a new user experience for Jenkins and providing an interactive view for Jenkins jobs and pipelines.
Pipeline:Pipeline is a workflow of group of events or jobs that are chained and interlinked with each other.to write the pipelines we use the Groovy programming language.
      
These are two types:
			1.Scripted Pipeline
			2.Declarative Pipeline

1.Scripted Pipeline:
  Node {
	Def name
	Stage(‘Build’) {
		Echo “Building’”
	}
	Stage(‘Deploy) {
		Echo “Deploying”
	}
	Stage(‘Test’) {
		Echo “Testing”
	}
 }

2.Declarative Pipeline:
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Hello') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing'
            }
        }
    }
}
